abstract={An empirical formula is proposed for the calculation of the viscosity of glycerol-water mixture for mass concentrations in the range of 0−100{\%} and temperatures varying from 0 to 100 {\textdegree}C. It compares well with three databases available in the literature, and its application procedure is also simpler than other previously developed correlations.},
